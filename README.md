# Advent Of Code 2019

My scripts to solve the challenges of the Advent Of Code 2019.

- What is the Advent Of Code?

   - Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
